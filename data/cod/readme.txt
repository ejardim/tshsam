The first iteration are the point estimates (best fit from SAM), and the subsequent 1000 iterations are derived from the variance-covariance matrix.

The sum of the catch numbers for these areas is somewhat lower than the numbers used in the combined assessment in ICES. It is due the discards probably being underestimated in the area based version and also to some differences in landings in STECF database and the ones used by ICES.  

In case it would be necessary for modelling purposes to get the numbers to match with ICES, one could perhaps just proportionally upscale the numbers in all areas. But it is clear that it is just a start to the area based assessment analyses and lot of improvements to the catch input data would certainly be needed if such analyses should continue in future.
